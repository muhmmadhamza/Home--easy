                    <h3>2.1 Invitations to Request an Offer</h3>
                    <p>An Offer Preview, Preliminary Offer, and Estimated Offer, are estimates of an HomeEasy Homes Offer (see 2.2.1 below).  These estimates are not appraisals. They are invitations for you to request an HomeEasy Homes Offer.</p>
                    <p>These estimates are calculated using publicly-available information and HomeEasy Homes’s proprietary valuation model. It typically takes into account hundreds of data sets related to your home and its location.</p>

                    <h3>2.2 Selling to HomeEasy Homes</h3>
                    <h3>2.2.1 HomeEasy Homes Offers</h3>
                    <p>An HomeEasy Homes InstantOffer is an offer by HomeEasy Homes to purchase a home.  You will be eligible to receive an HomeEasy Homes InstantOffer after you provide us with information about your home and (i) you are the owner or represent the owner of the home, (ii) the home is in one of our service areas, (iii) the home meets our current home-buying parameters, which may change from time to time for a given service area under our sole discretion and (iv) we have had an opportunity to assess your home.</p>
                    <p>An HomeEasy Homes InstantOffer is not an appraisal. It is the purchase price HomeEasy Homes is willing to pay for your home, subject to additional terms, conditions, and fees outlined in the offer.</p>
                    <p><strong>In the event that HomeEasy Homes makes you an offer on your home, HomeEasy Homes is not acting as your real estate agent or broker; nor does HomeEasy Homes represent you in any capacity as a seller. HomeEasy Homes is merely acting as, or on behalf of, a purchaser of real estate. As a seller, you have the right, and it is your responsibility, to independently evaluate and decide whether to accept the HomeEasy Homes Offer.</strong></p>

                    <h3>2.2.2 [Reserved]</h3>
                    <h3>2.2.3 After You’ve Sold</h3>
                    <p>Please ensure you’ve contacted the U.S. Postal Service to set up address forwarding to your new address effective as of your close date. Also, be sure to update your address anywhere that you regularly order packages from.  Once your home sale has closed, we disclaim all liability for any mail or packages delivered to the property.</p>

                    <p>By accessing any HomeEasy Homes Home, you accept legal and financial responsibility for any damage you cause to the Premises and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any bodily, mental, or personal injury, including death, relating to or arising from accessing or visiting the Premises.</p>

                    <p>If you contract to purchase a home from HomeEasy Homes (“Seller”), you (“Buyer”) agree to the following additional terms and conditions regarding your purchase of the home (the “Property”).

                    <p>Seller has provided Buyer with an opportunity to inspect the Property, and strongly encourages Buyer to seek an inspection on the Property by a licensed home inspector. Buyer further recognizes Seller has not resided in the Property and has limited knowledge thereof.

                    <h3>2.5.2 Representation of HomeEasy Homes</h3>
                    <p>In the event you choose to buy an HomeEasy Homes Home or sell your home to HomeEasy Homes, an HomeEasy Homes Brokerage will represent HomeEasy Homes in the transaction.</p>

                    <h3>2.5.3 Working with an HomeEasy Homes Partner Agent</h3>
                    <p>At your request, an HomeEasy Homes Brokerage can refer you to a third-party agent that can represent you in your home purchase or sale (“HomeEasy Homes Partner Agent”), and you may be eligible for promotions for working with that agent. Should you choose to work with that agent, the referring brokerage will receive a referral fee. However, we never require you to choose any particular agent to buy or sell a home.</p>

                    <h3>2.5.4 Working with an HomeEasy Homes Agent – Agency Relationships</h3>
                    <p>In certain service areas, you may have the option to be represented by an agent at an HomeEasy Homes Brokerage (an “HomeEasy Homes Agent”) in your home purchase or sale.  However, an HomeEasy Homes Agent will not be able to represent you if you sell your home to HomeEasy Homes, and may not be able to represent you in other types of transactions where an HomeEasy Homes Brokerage is representing another party.  In those instances, you remain welcome to work with an HomeEasy Homes Partner Agent or another agent of your choice.</p>
                    <p>HomeEasy Homes Agents may only enter into single agency representation agreements.  Dual agency is prohibited for HomeEasy Homes Agents including in service areas where dual agency is permitted by law. Dual Agency or Limited Agency may occur in transactions where a buyer and a seller are both represented by an HomeEasy Homes Brokerage.  Where eligible Disclosed Dual Agency transactions occur, only the designated broker may be entered into dual agency representation; each client will have separate single agency representation in the transaction.</p>

Prior to a home tour, you will receive an email with information about your Tour Assistant. Please note that visiting a home with a Tour Assistant does not establish an agency or contractual relationship between you and that Tour Assistant. We always welcome you to seek representation from the agent of your choice.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>In the case of a Third Party Home, you must provide a copy of a licensed general inspection report, and we reserve the right not to offer the Guarantee if there is any material defect identified in the report (e.g., foundation issues, roof damage, inoperable HVAC systems, unpermitted additions) or if we determine the purchase price is materially above the fair market value of the home. We will contact you within 48 hours of receipt of the report if this is the case.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, to qualify, you must have purchased the home as a primary residence, and moved into and resided in the home. You may not lease or otherwise permit tenants in the home. And you may not have previously returned another home to HomeEasy Homes in the past 36 months.</p>
                    <p><strong>Return Conditions</strong></p>
                    <p>To return the home, send an email to buyback@HomeEasyHomes.com no later than <strong>ninety (90) days</strong> after the close of escrow (the “Closing Date”) with the following information:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The address of the home.</li>
                        <li>The Closing Date.</li>
                        <li>A request to return the home under the Guarantee.</li>
                        <li>The date on which you will move out of the Property, which must be within 40 days from the date the email notice is sent (“Notice Date”).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You will then fill out a short application certifying that (1) you purchased the home as a primary residence and resided in it, (2) no tenants were permitted to reside at the home, (3) you have not previously returned another home to HomeEasy Homes in the past 36 months, and (4) you will fully vacate and remove belongings from the home within 40 days of the Notice Date.</p>
                    <p>Before we re-purchase the home, the following must also be true:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There has been no Material Detrimental Change to the property since the Closing Date. “Material Detrimental Change” shall mean any change or changes to the property subsequent to the Closing Date, regardless of its cause, that, taken individually or together, materially impact the property’s value or habitability, as determined in HomeEasy Homes’s reasonable, good faith sole discretion, including, but not limited to, non-minor damage to the property; removal or modification of any major fixtures; impacts by acts of God, fire, flood, hail, wind, earthquake, war, epidemic, riot or terrorism, casualty loss; a housing market decline represented by a 5% or greater annualized decline in the seasonally adjusted Case-Shiller Home Price Index for the region in which the property is located measured over the most recent month for which the index is available, or declines of any amount in the two most recent months for which the index is available; a stock market decline represented by a 10% or greater annualized decline in the S&P 500 Index measured from the Closing Date to the Notice Date; or in the event that HomeEasy Homes becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy.</li>
                        <li>Your certifications in your return application must be true, accurate, and complete at the time of the return closing.</li>
                        <li>All liens and encumbrances incurred since the Closing Date must be paid in full or otherwise removed by the Buyer at or prior to the return closing.</li>
                        <li>Any solar lease, loan, or power purchase agreement must be fully pre-paid and transferred to HomeEasy Homes at or prior to the return closing.</li>
                        <li>Title to the property has not changed since the Closing Date and there may be no disputes affecting title or liens, other than those arising due to any act by HomeEasy Homes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Following receipt of your notice and application, unless the home does not otherwise qualify for the Guarantee, we will schedule an assessment to evaluate the condition of the home. We agree to schedule the assessment and you agree to facilitate it within 5 days of receiving your notice and application. We will give you the results of the assessment within 5 days of completing it.</p>
                    <p>Subject to meeting all the above conditions, HomeEasy Homes will purchase the home from you pursuant to its standard form agreement, which we will provide to you, for the following price:</p>
                    <p>The purchase price of the home on the Closing Date minus seller concessions reflected on the closing statement (“Adjusted Purchase Price”) less a 3% fee (the “Return Fee”), less any commission refund you received for working with an HomeEasy Homes Agent or HomeEasy Homes Partner Agent (“Commission Refund”). If our assessment discloses needed repairs, we will also identify and debit repair costs.</p>
                    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, HomeEasy Homes’s maximum financial obligation associated with a return under the 90-Day Guarantee will not exceed 97% of the Adjusted Purchase Price.</p>
